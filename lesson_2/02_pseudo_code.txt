1) a method that returns the sum of two integers

Given two integers.

Sum the values of both integers.

Return the value.


START

# Given two integers

PRINT int1 + int2

END



2) a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

Given an array of strings.

Save the first value of the array as a string variable

Iterate through the collection one by one except the first value
	- for each iteration save the concatenated words to the string variable

After iterating through the collection, return the saved string variable.


START

# Given an array of strings

SET sentence = first value of array
iterator = 1

WHILE iterator < array size
	SET sentence += value within string collection
	go to the next iteration

PRINT words

END



3) a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

Given an array of integers

Create a new empty array.

Iterate through the collection
	- for each iteration check if "iterator" index is an odd number
	- if index at iteration is odd save the value in the new array

After iterating through the collection, return the saved value.


START

# Given an array of integers

SET new_array = []
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator < length of given array
	IF "iterator" index is an odd number
		SET new_array << value within given array

	iterator += 1

PRINT new_array

END
