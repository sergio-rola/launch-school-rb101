# We are entering the recursive method after each guess not allowing the loop to work as intended (it is not looping at all). This means a different winning_number sample each time we guess. We want to "try" to guess the winning_number, a certain number of attempts up to the max_attempts value and not just once. After deleting the superfluous recursive method, the loop is working properly as attempts variable is now getting incremented. The only missing code is a breaking condition when we guess the number to exit the loop.Â
